# Applied-Data-Science

**Course Description:**
- This comprehensive 12-week course is designed to transition intermediate Python developers into proficient data scientists. By dedicating one hour daily, five days a week, participants will engage in a structured learning path that covers the fundamental to advanced aspects of data science.
- The course begins with the basics of data science, including essential tools and Python libraries, and progresses through statistics, data manipulation, and exploratory data analysis. As participants advance, they will delve into core and intermediate machine learning techniques, data engineering essentials, and modern big data technologies.
- Key highlights include practical applications of machine learning algorithms, an introduction to neural networks and deep learning, and explorations into natural language processing. Each week builds on the last, ensuring that foundational knowledge is solidified while new, more complex topics are introduced and explored.
- Participants will also undertake a capstone project in the final week, applying all learned skills to a real-world data problem, culminating in a presentation of their findings.
